Parts
-----
+ ATtiny85 (probably ATtiny25 would be suffice, but not confirmed)
+ Battery and its holder
+ Speaker (Buzzer)
+ Music Box IC (3 pins)
+ Tact Switch for the start/reset button
+ 10K ohm resistor for Pull-Down on the tact switch
+ Toggle Switch for power (2 pins)
+ 3 LEDs (need or include appropriate resistors)
+ 6 pin-header for ICSP (optional, but recommended for flashing firmware)
+ 2 jumper wires for ICSP (2-sided PCB wouldn't need this)
